```bash
$ docker build build-arg=$(shell whoami) -t intro-embedded-systems-project1
```

```bash
$ docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD:/app" ruby:2.3 bash
```


`--rm` - removes container once finished
`-it` - interactive mode
`-v "$PWD:/app"` - volume: takes current working directory and share it inside the container as `/app` 
`ruby:2.3` - the image we want to run
`bash` - run bash as we want to do some stuff
